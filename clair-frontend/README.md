# Clair EHR — Frontend Prototype

`src/ClairEHR.jsx` is the single-file React prototype for the clinic/patient
app, merged from three uploaded prototype exports (two were byte-identical;
the third was a strict superset adding the features below) and rebranded
from "Arogya" to "Clair" to match this repository's name.

## Features merged in from the newer prototype

- **Rich OPD note editor** — a contentEditable free-text note area with a
  right-click formatting menu (bold/italic/underline/strikethrough, cut/copy/
  paste, undo, clear formatting) and an Insert → Templates flyout with
  boilerplate text blocks (normal exam, stable follow-up, discharge advice,
  referral, teleconsultation). Clicking an OPD tool icon now also drops a
  heading into the note.
- **OPD tool bar** switched from labelled pill buttons to a compact icon
  toolbar (one icon per tool: HPI, vitals, examination, differential
  diagnosis, workup, diagnosis/plan, triage, consent, MLC).
- **Sponsored ad cards** now support three types — `banner` (static image,
  default), `video` (muted looping inline clip), and `popup` (opens an
  in-app expanded overlay instead of leaving the app) — via `AdCard` and
  `AdPopupModal`.
- **Hospital sidebar** — "Build a hospital" and "Camp / medical aid mode"
  are now grouped under a collapsible "Admin" section alongside Statistics,
  Bed availability, Inventory manager, Planner, Follow-ups and Virtual OPD,
  with a scrollable nav and chevron (rather than +/-) expand/collapse
  indicators.
- Library modal and sidebar nav scrolling/overflow fixes.

## Renaming

All in-app branding was updated from "Arogya" to "Clair":

- "Arogya Clinic" → "Clair Clinic" (patient home screen, discharge slip
  footer, hospital directory, hospital-affiliation form placeholders)
- `arogyaclinic.app` feedback links → `clairclinic.app`
- The exported component `ArogyaEHR` → `ClairEHR`
